# Apolemia
A small game framework coded entirely in C++

**/!\ Very early in development, not functional yet**

What's already implemented:
- Creating views to store entities
- Storing entities with different components
- Applying systems to entities if they contain all the required components
- Applying systems depending on events
- Displaying entities' sprite on screen

What needs to be implemented:
- Loading entities from a text file
- Custom keybinding
- Switching between views
